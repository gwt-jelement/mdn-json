  "description": "This is an experimental technology Because this technology\u0027s specification has not stabilized, check the compatibility table for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes. The PerformanceNavigationTiming interface provides methods and properties to store and retrieve high resolution timestamps or metrics regarding the browser\u0027s document navigation events. For example, this interface can be used to determine how much time it takes to load or unload a document.",
