  "description": "This is an experimental technology Because this technology\u0027s specification has not stabilized, check the compatibility table for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes. The DeviceLightEvent provides web developers with information from photo sensors or similiar detectors about ambient light levels near the device. For example this may be useful to adjust the screen\u0027s brightness based on the current ambient light level in order to save energy or provide better readability.",
