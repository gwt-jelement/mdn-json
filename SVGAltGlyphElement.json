Avoid using it and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time. The SVGAltGlyphElement interface represents an \u003caltglyph\u003e element. This interface makes it possible to implement more sophisticated and particular glyph characters. For some textal representations as: ligatures (e.g. æ, ß, etc ), special-purpose fonts (e.g. musical symbols) or even alternate glyphs such as Asian text strings it is required that a different set of glyphs be used than the normal given character data.",
