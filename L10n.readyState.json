  "description": "Non-standard This feature is not on a current W3C standards track, but it is supported on the Firefox OS platform. Although implementations may change in the future and it is not supported widely across browsers, it is suitable for use in code dedicated to Firefox OS apps.   The readyState property returns either loading or complete — depending on the current state of the L10n context. readyState should be used sparingly;  L10n.ready() and L10n.once() are usually better suited for controlling when code is run relative to the state of the localization.",
