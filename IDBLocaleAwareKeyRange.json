  "description": "This is an experimental technology Because this technology\u0027s specification has not stabilized, check the compatibility table for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes. The IDBLocaleAwareKeyRange interface of the IndexedDB API is a Firefox-specific version of IDBKeyRange — it functions in exactly the same fashion, and has the same properties and methods, but it is intended for use with IDBIndex objects when the original index had a locale value specified upon its creation (see createIndex()\u0027s optionalParameters) — that is, it has locale aware sorting enabled.",
