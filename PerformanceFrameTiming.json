  "description": "This is an experimental technology Because this technology\u0027s specification has not stabilized, check the compatibility table for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes. The PerformanceFrameTiming interface provides frame timing data about the browser\u0027s event loop. A frame represents the amount of work a browser does in one event loop such as processing DOM events, resizing, scrolling, rendering, CSS animations, etc. A frame rate of 60fps (frames per second) for a 60Hz refresh rate is the target for a good responsive user experience. This means the browser should process a frame in about 16.7ms.",
