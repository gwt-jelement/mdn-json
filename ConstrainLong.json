  "name": "ConstrainLong",
  "description": "The ConstrainLong type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is an integral number. It extends the LongRange dictionary (which provides the ability to specify a permitted range of property values) to also support an exact value and/or an ideal value the property should take on. In addition, you can specify the value as a simple long integer value, in which case the user agent does its best to match the value once all other more stringent constraints are met.",
